## ðŸ“œ Why ReasoningTrap?

> Current RL-tuned Reasoning LLMs excel at *producing* answers, but often ignore explicit user constraints.  
> **ReasoningTrap** surfaces these failure modes with carefully crafted, *conditioned* problems.
* **Modified from Famous MATH Reasoning Benchmark** â€“ AIME & MATH500 problems altered with minimal constraints to divert reasoning paths.
* **Puzzles Trivialized by Subtle Modifications** - Well-known puzzles where a small change transforms a challenging problem into a trivial one.
* **Plug-and-play** â€“ evaluate any ðŸ¤— Transformers, vLLM or OpenAI-style chat model in two lines.
